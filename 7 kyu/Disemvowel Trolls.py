# Trolls are attacking your comment section!
#
# A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
#
# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
#
# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
#
# Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

def disemvowel(string_):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    result = ''
    for char in string_:
        if char not in vowels:
            result += char
    return result


print(disemvowel('This website is for losers LOL!'))
