# The President's phone is broken
# He is not very happy.
#
# The only letters still working are uppercase E, F, I, R, U, Y.
#
# An angry tweet is sent to the department responsible for presidential phone maintenance.
#
# Kata Task
# Decipher the tweet by looking for words with known meanings.
#
# FIRE = "You are fired!"
# FURY = "I am furious."
# If no known words are found, or unexpected letters are encountered, then it must be a "Fake tweet."
#
# Notes
# The tweet reads left-to-right.
# Any letters not spelling words FIRE or FURY are just ignored
# If multiple of the same words are found in a row then plural rules apply -
# FIRE x 1 = "You are fired!"
# FIRE x 2 = "You and you are fired!"
# FIRE x 3 = "You and you and you are fired!"
# etc...
# FURY x 1 = "I am furious."
# FURY x 2 = "I am really furious."
# FURY x 3 = "I am really really furious."
# etc...
# Examples
# ex1. FURYYYFIREYYFIRE = "I am furious. You and you are fired!"
# ex2. FIREYYFURYYFURYYFURRYFIRE = "You are fired! I am really furious. You are fired!"
# ex3. FYRYFIRUFIRUFURE = "Fake tweet."
