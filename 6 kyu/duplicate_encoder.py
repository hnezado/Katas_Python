# The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "("
# if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in
# the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
#
# Examples
# "din"      =>  "((("
# "recede"   =>  "()()()"
# "Success"  =>  ")())())"
# "(( @"     =>  "))(("
# Notes
#
# Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX",
# the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!
